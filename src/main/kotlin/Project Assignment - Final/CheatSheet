 # Cheat Sheet:

  1. For making the Robot, create a class Robot and give its name as a primary parameter.
  2. The tasks performed by the Robot will become the functions of this class. Each function will simply print the tasks being performed.
  3. The variants for each function will become the parameters of those functions. For storing similar items, try to make use of ArrayList and its functions.
  4. After this use the object-oriented techniques using this Robot class in your main function.
  5. Also, for some detailed objects like ingredients for coffee, create a data class Coffee and put its parameters in those. You can do this for other functions as well.


                                       All the best! Happy Coding :)
